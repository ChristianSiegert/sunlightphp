INTRODUCTION
============

Hello there,

thanks for downloading SunlightPHP. I put many weeks of work into this small and
fast PHP framework. I specifically created it for my needs, it is not an
all-rounder and might not be suited for your purposes. Try it and find out.


REQUIREMENTS
============
	
	* PHP 5.3
		* curl module
			$ sudo apt-get install php5-curl
		* intl module
			$ sudo apt-get install php5-intl
	
	* PHPUnit
		$ sudo apt-get install phpunit
			
	* Apache 2
		$ sudo apt-get install apache2
		
		* Add directive "AllowEncodedSlashes On" to Apache server config or
		virtual host file.
	
	* CouchDB 0.10
		$ sudo apt-get install couchdb
		

STEP 1
======

After copying SunlightPHP to the location of your choice, make sure your server
is set up correctly. You can do this by browsing to

	http://example.com/sunlightphp/maintenance/maintenance.php
	
Replace "example.com" with your server's address.
	

STEP 2
======

Open the file app/config/core.php and adjust the settings to suit your needs.

	STEP 2.1 (OPTIONAL)
	-------------------
	
	If you enable JS and/or CSS compression, you need to download the
	YUICompressor from http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/ and place it
	in app/vendors/yuicompressor/yuicompressor-2.4.2.jar
	
	You will also need Java.
		$ sudo apt-get install default-jre
	

	STEP 2.2 (OPTIONAL)
	-------------------
	
	If you enable caching with APC, you need to have APC installed as a PHP
	module.
	
	$ sudo apt-get install php-apc
	
	
	STEP 2.3 (OPTIONAL)
	-------------------
	
	If you enable caching with Memcached, you need to have the Memcache module
	installed for PHP.

	$ sudo apt-get install memcached php5-memcache


TIPS
====

	TIP ONE
	-------

	If you want to access CouchDB on a remote server, e.g. for administration
	with the pretty front-end Futon, you can make it accessible with:

		$ ssh -L {1}:localhost:{2} {3}@{4}
	
		{1}	The port on your localhost you want to bind the CouchDB from the
			remote server to.
		{2}	The port CouchDB occupies on your remote server. CouchDB listens by
			default to port 5984.
		{3} Your username for the remote server.
		{4} The IP address of your remote server.
		
	With all the placeholders replaced, it can look something like this:
		$ ssh -L 5985:localhost:5984 root@109.74.204.144

	Congratulations, you can now access your remote server's CouchDB simply by
	browsing to http://localhost:5985/ .
	
	
	TIP TWO
	-------
	
	If you want to access SunlightPHP's maintenance panel on a remote server,
	follow these steps:
			
	1.	Add "127.0.0.1 {name}" to the /etc/hosts file on your localhost. Replace
		{name} with a unique name you made up, e.g. an abbreviation of your
		domain name, so you can remember it well.
		
		For projects hosted on christian-siegert.com I use "cs" as name, i.e. my
		localhost /etc/hosts file contains "127.0.0.1 cs".
		
	2.	Add the name as a server alias in your remote server's VirtualHost
		configuration file. This file is usually located at /etc/apache2/sites-
		available. Look for a line starting with "ServerAlias" and append the
		name there.
				
		Continuing with the example from above, I edited /etc/apache2/sites-
		available/christian-siegert.com and updated the list of server aliases
		to "ServerAlias www.christian-siegert.com cs"
		
	3.	You can now access the SunlightPHP maintenance panel on your remote
		server from your localhost with something like:
			$ ssh -L 8080:christian-siegert.com:80 root@109.74.204.144
			
		Browse to http://cs:8080/ on your localhost to see it.
