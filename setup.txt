INTRODUCTION
============

Hello there,

thanks for downloading SunlightPHP. I put many weeks of work into this small and
fast PHP framework. I specifically created it for my needs, it is not an
all-rounder and might not be suited for your purposes. Try it and find out.


REQUIREMENTS
============
	
	* PHP 5.3
		* curl module
			$ sudo apt-get install php5-curl
		* intl module
			$ sudo apt-get install php5-intl
	
	* PHPUnit
		$ sudo apt-get install phpunit
			
	* Apache 2
		$ sudo apt-get install apache2
		
		* Add directive "AllowEncodedSlashes On" to Apache server config or
		virtual host file.
	
	* CouchDB 0.10
		$ sudo apt-get install couchdb
		

STEP 1
======

After copying SunlightPHP to the location of your choice, make sure your server
is set up correctly. You can do this by browsing to

	http://example.com/sunlightphp/maintenance/maintenance.php
	
Replace "example.com" with your server's address.
	

STEP 2
======

Open the file app/config/core.php and adjust the settings to suit your needs.

	STEP 2.1 (OPTIONAL)
	-------------------
	
	If you enable JS and/or CSS compression, you need to download the
	YUICompressor from http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/ and place it
	in app/vendors/yuicompressor/yuicompressor-2.4.2.jar
	
	You will also need Java.
		$ sudo apt-get install default-jre
	

	STEP 2.2 (OPTIONAL)
	-------------------
	
	If you enable caching with APC, you need to have APC installed as a PHP
	module.
	
	$ sudo apt-get install php-apc
	
	
	STEP 2.3 (OPTIONAL)
	-------------------
	
	If you enable caching with Memcached, you need to have the Memcache module
	installed for PHP.

	$ sudo apt-get install memcached php5-memcache


TIPS
====

If you want to access CouchDB on a remote server, i.e. for administration with
the pretty front-end Futon, you can make it accessible with:

	$ ssh -L {1}:localhost:{2} {3}@{4}
	
		{1}	The port on your localhost you want to bind the CouchDB from the
			remote server to.
		{2}	The port CouchDB occupies on your remote server. CouchDB listens by
			default to port 5984.
		{3} Your username for the remote server.
		{4} The IP address of your remote server.
		
With all the placeholders replaced, it can look something like this:
	$ ssh -L 5985:localhost:5984 root@109.74.204.144

Congratulations, you can now access your remote server's CouchDB simply by
browsing to http://localhost:5985/ .
