INTRODUCTION
============

Hello there,

thanks for downloading SunlightPHP. I put a lot of weeks into this small and
fast PHP framework. I specifically created it for my needs, it is not an
all-rounder and might not be suited for your purposes. Try it and find out.


REQUIREMENTS
============

	* PHP 5.3
		* with CURL module ($ sudo apt-get install php5-curl)
	* Apache
	* CouchDB 0.10 ($ sudo apt-get install couchdb)


STEP 1
======

After copying SunlightPHP to the location of your choice, make sure your server
is set up correctly. You can do this by browsing to

	http://example.com/sunlightphp/maintenance.php
	
Replace "example.com" with your server's address.
	

STEP 2
======

Open the file app/config/core.php and adjust the settings to your
needs.

	STEP 2.1 (OPTIONAL)
	-------------------
	
	If you enable JS and/or CSS compression, you need to download the
	YUICompressor from http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/ and place it
	in app/vendors/yuicompressor/yuicompressor-2.4.2.jar
	

	STEP 2.2 (OPTIONAL)
